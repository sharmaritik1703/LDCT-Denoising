# LDCT-Denoising
This is a deep learning pipeline for translating low-dose CT scans into high-dose CT scans. It uses encoder-decoder-based models for image denoising, such as UNet with convolution layers. Multi-head attention is incorporated to extract local and global features from low-dose CT scan images.
